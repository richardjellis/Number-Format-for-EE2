Convert numbers like "1234" into human friendly numbers like "1,234.00".  It's based on your PHP regional settings and the PHP number_format function.

Works in three ways.

1) Number as a paramater:
	{exp:number_format number="1234" decimals="2"}

2) Number as tag content:
	{exp:number_format decimals="2"}1234{/exp:number_format}

3) Number as a publish filter:
	Setup in the control panel.

Special Thanks to Patrick M (@whak) for PM'ing me on EE forums to make this
version based on the old version.
